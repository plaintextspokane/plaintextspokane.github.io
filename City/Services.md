**Public Health**

The local health department for Spokane is actually the Spokane Regional Health District (SRHD) - it differs slightly from other health departments in the state in that it is a special district outside of the main Spokane County office. It's website is here: <a href="https://srhd.org/" target="_blank">SRHD.org ↑</a>

One of the services SRHD provides is access to Data and Reports on health in our region. See that page and its resources here: <a href="https://srhd.org/data-and-reports" target="_blank">Data and Reports ↑</a>
