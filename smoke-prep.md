# Prepare Your Home for Smoke

1. Check weather and Air Quality Index (AQI) daily during wildfire season.
   - Recommended: [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov) or [Spokane Regional Clean Air](https://www.spokanecleanair.org/)

2. Seal drafts around windows and doors using weatherstripping or painter’s tape.

3. Replace HVAC filters with MERV 13 if your system can handle it.

4. Identify a “clean room”:
   - Choose a bedroom or small living room with few windows.
   - Close the door and seal gaps.
   - Run a HEPA or DIY air filter.
