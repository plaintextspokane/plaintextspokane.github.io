**Make a Clean Room**

1. A "clean room" is a room within your house or apartment where you minimize outside air exchanges. 

2. Preferably it is a room you and your family/ housemates can reside in comfortably for a few hours. 

3. Close the door and seal any windows or gaps. Use tape or blankets if necessary. 

4. Run a HEPA or [DIY filter](diy-filter) inside the room.
